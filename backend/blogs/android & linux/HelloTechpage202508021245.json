A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment.[71] According to the World Economic Forum's \"The Future of Jobs Report 2020\", AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide, and create 97 million new jobs by 2025.[72][73] From 1990 to 2007, a study in the U.S. by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu showed that an addition of one robot for every 1,000 workers decreased the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2%, or about 3.3 workers, and lowered wages by 0.42%.[74][75] Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting.

In 1975, there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S.; by 1989, this increased to an average of one citation per patent. The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry, chemistry, and electronics.[133] A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents.[134]\nOther animal species\nSee also: Tool use by animals, Structures built by animals, and Ecosystem engineer\nPhoto of a gorilla walking hip-deep in a pond, holding a stick\nThis adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the water's depth."
